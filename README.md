### Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is any positivity bias from Vine members in the selected dataset

### Results:

- There were 613 vine reviews and 64,968 non-vine reviews
- There were 30,765 total 5-star reviews and 30,543 of them were non-vine
- Roughly 36% of vine reviews are 5-star while roughly 47% of non-vine reviews are 5-star

### Summary:

It doesn't appear that there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. In fact, there's an 11% higher probability that a non-vine reviwer will leave a 5-star review compared to a vine reviwer. Another analysis would be to test for negativity bias, running the same calculations but filtering the dataset for 1-star reviews instead of 5-star reviews.
